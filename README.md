# Python Snake
A simple snake game made in Python and Pygame

### Why did I make it?
Awesome question - I wanted a simple thing as an introduction to Pygame for my other (much more complex) project, so I felt like a snake game would do the job.

## How to play it:
You don't have to do much in order to run this game, just install the pygame and cv2 packages (`pip install pygame cv2`) and you are set to go.

## Controls:
You can either use the arrow keys or WASD to move the snake. You can not change your direction to the current opposite (for example if you are going up, you can't immediately go down and crash into yourself). If you die, you can restart by pressing the `R` key on your keyboard, the space key, or by clicking your mouse.<br>
If you want to close the game, you can do so by clicking the close window button in the top right corner of the window or you can also double-press the escape key (if you are alive - if you are on the game over screen, only one escape key press is required to quit).
